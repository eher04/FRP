As of the beginning of September, I have assumed the role of the Program Manager at Options Community Services Family Resource Programs from Rose Slatinek.
 
Karen Norman, our Deputy Executive Director passed along BCFRP's September e-News and it was a great read.  In order to ensure that I keep aprised of everything going on at the association (and elsewhere) I would ask that you please make the change in your data bank to replace Rose's contact name, information and email for mine.
 
Thank you amd have a great day,

I realize the April 25 deadline is fast approaching and unfortunately I have not been able to devote much time to this yet,
North Peace Community Resources Society has just had our site visit from Carf in March and The Family Place was part of this process so our accredition with Carf should be here soon (previously the agency was accreditated COA but The Family Place was not part of that process).  
One hurdle at a time: first accreditaion and now FRP standards-  
Question- the information I have read tells acrreditated agencies to focus on B- Do you have any completed templates I can use as a guide so I can get a feel of what it is I need to write to descibe what we do? Unfortunately, I have to work on this alone and wording is difficult for me - I know what we do to meet the standard but struggle with getting it down on paper- not to mention my typing is slow. A completed version would help in that I could revise it to reflect what we do at our Family Place without having to start from scratch.
 
As an accreditated agency-I will be able to use the worksheet to cross reference the policies where policies are required- Do I have to do the A part where policies are not required and it is not part of B template? And if so -what am I supposed to do?
 
Clarification on what is required to submit:
•	the worksheet with policies cross-referenced and the document that has our policies 
•	B template completed
Thanks, Pam

Dear Debbie,

Allow me to introduce myself-I am Annette Witteman-the new President of the Mayne Island Early Childhood Society-I have been involved as a parent and (part time) Mother Goose Program provider for the past 3 years on Mayne Island and have been a MIECS member since incorporation. I appreciate the complexities and growing pains of a new and young society geographically isolated from both Sault Spring Island and Vancouver. We the new board will need to study how we can make the process as streamlined and effective as possible for the future-we will be holding our first meeting on Sunday and will receive an update from Tina as to how things are ironing out-Also we are working on our charitable status as a society. I look forward to working with you and the BC Association of Family Resource Programs in the future and appreciate your co-operation in clarifying our situation.

Sincerely
Annette Witteman
